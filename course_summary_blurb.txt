Choosing statistical methods

Most classes on machine learning, mathematical modeling, and statistics focus on how to use a specified model. They give students the technical skills to minimize a cost function, solve a fluid flow equation, train a neural network on a task, or construct a 95% margin of error for an opinion poll. Compared to the voluminous answers for "How?", less attention is given to "When?" and "Why?" one would use each method. This course will balance the scales, helping students guide their choice of methods by offering a menu of principles. Each meeting will be themed around one principle, such as "this method should tolerate wild outliers," "this method should tolerate certain mistaken assumptions," or "this method should make optimal use of limited data." Using computer simulations, students will evaluate multiple methods with respect to each principle, exploring the limits of alternative methods and rendering judgements about when they are usable. The course will introduce the basics of statistics and computer programming -- not comprehensively but with enough detail to participate fully.

Principles that may be discussed:

- Minimize a deliberately chosen cost function
- Tolerate mistaken assumptions (example: permutation test???)
- Tolerate outliers 
- Make efficient use of limited samples
- Be conservative by declaring an effect to exist only if there is strong evidence for it
- Be conservative by declaring an effect not to exist only if there is strong evidence against it
