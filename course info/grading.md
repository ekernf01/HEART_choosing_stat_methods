### Grading

**For Fall 2023 at JHU, this document does not apply -- it's pass/fail. See the syllabus for grading info.**

Grades in this class seek to describing you your readiness to engage in computer-aided critical thinking about statistical problems, as of the end of the class. Specific assignments will be accompanied by binary rubrics. Scores will be aggregated and discretized *ad hoc* in order to reflect the descriptions below.

- D is for data insufficient: you turned in some work at the A, B, or C levels, but not consistently.
- C is for consistency: with frequent support, you regularly improve your code and your written descriptions f results. 
- B is for basics: you get your code working with frequent support, and you describe the results accurately.
- A is for autonomy: you design and debug your simulations with minimal support, because you take the initiative to isolate bugs and seek your own solutions. You produce well-organized descriptions of your results with thoughtful commentary that connects to the main point of the lesson.
