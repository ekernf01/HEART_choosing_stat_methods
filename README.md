## Choosing statistical methods

This is a light, fun, 1hr/week undergraduate class designed for JHU's [HEART](https://engineering.jhu.edu/education/undergraduate-studies/heart-courses/).

The class is not quite ready for public consumption -- check back here soon for a Fall 2022 *syllabus*, which is the authoritative source of information about all administrative aspects of the class, and for a more transparent layout of the course content.

### Why?

Most classes on machine learning, mathematical modeling, and statistics focus on how to use a specified model. They give students the technical skills to minimize a cost function, solve a fluid flow equation, train a neural network on a task, or construct a 95% margin of error for a relative risk estimate. Compared to the voluminous answers for "How?", less attention is given to "When?" and "Why?" one would use each method. 

This course will balance the scales, helping students guide their choice of methods by offering a menu of *principles*. Each meeting will be themed around one principle, such as "a method should tolerate wild outliers," "a method should tolerate certain mistaken assumptions," or "a method should make optimal use of limited data." Using computer simulations, students will evaluate multiple methods with respect to each principle, exploring the limits of alternative methods and rendering judgements about when they are usable. The course will introduce the basics of statistics and computer programming -- not comprehensively but with enough detail to participate fully.
